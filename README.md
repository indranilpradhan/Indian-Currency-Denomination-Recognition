# Indian-Currency-Denomination-Recognition

We use the local feature descriptor to extract the image features which are distinct and different from other image features. It generally includes edges , corners etc. Previous neural network techniques work great on flat images or good images. But we here consider images for visually impaired people which may be wrinkled, folded or untidy. Thatâ€™s the bigger challenge we need to handle. 


In this project we tried to build an application that could recognize the indian currency bills using computer vision techniques. This is a robust system works without help from server. Finally it produces an audio output which tells about the value of the currency.
